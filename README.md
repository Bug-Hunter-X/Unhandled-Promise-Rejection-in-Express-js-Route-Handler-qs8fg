# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous route handlers.  When an asynchronous operation within a route handler throws an error, the application might crash silently without proper error handling. This example shows how to reproduce the issue and how to fix it.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with a route handler that performs an asynchronous operation.  The operation can either resolve successfully or reject with an error.  However, the current error handling is insufficientâ€”it only logs the error to the console but doesn't send an appropriate response to the client.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the application with proper error handling.  It uses a `try...catch` block to handle errors that might occur during the asynchronous operation and sends an appropriate error response to the client.  This prevents the application from crashing and provides a more robust user experience.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.  Refresh the page several times; you might see error messages in the console, but the application will likely remain operational.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js`. You'll see a proper error response from the server.
